Readme for Octeon shared memory malloc

This malloc is based on ptmalloc2, which is the malloc
implementation of glibc.  Source code and more information
on this can be found at http://www.malloc.de/en/index.html.
This code is licensed under the GNU Library General Public 
License, which means that only source for this code must
be release.  This code can be linked to other code without
licensing issues.

The main change to the code modifies the way the malloc
gets memory from the system.  Under Linux/Unix, malloc
uses the brk or memmap sytem calls to request more memory.
In this implementation, memory regions must be explicitly
given to malloc by the application.
