Readme for the Octeon Executive Library


The Octeon Executive Library provides runtime support and hardware 
abstraction for the Octeon processor.  The executive is composed of the 
libcvmx.a library as well as header files that provide  
functionality with inline functions.


Usage:

The libcvmx.a library is built for every application as part of the
application build. (Please refer to the 'related pages' section of the 
HTML documentation for more information on the build system.)  
Applications using the executive should include the header files from
$OCTEON_ROOT/target/include and link against the library that is built in 
the local obj direcotry. Each file using the executive 
should include the following two header files in order:

#include "cvmx-config.h"
#include "cvmx.h"

The cvmx-config.h file contains configuration information for the 
executive.  A sample version of this is provided in the executive 
directory as 'cvmx-config.template'.  Copy this file to 'cvmx-config.h'
into the 'config' subdirectory of the application directory and customize 
as required by the application. Applications that don't use any simple 
executive functionality can omit the cvmx-config.h header file. Please
refer to the examples for a demonstration of where to put the 
cvmx-config.h file.

For file specific information please see the documentation within the 
source files or the HTML documentation provided in docs/html/index.html.
The HTML documentation is automatically generated by Doxygen from the 
source files.
