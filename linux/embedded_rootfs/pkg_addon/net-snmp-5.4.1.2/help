`configure' configures Net-SNMP 5.4.1.2 to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print `checking...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or `..']

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
			  [/usr/local]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
			  [PREFIX]

By default, `make install' will install all the files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix',
for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR          system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR       program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]
  --datadir=DIR          read-only architecture-independent data [PREFIX/share]
  --sysconfdir=DIR       read-only single-machine data [PREFIX/etc]
  --sharedstatedir=DIR   modifiable architecture-independent data [PREFIX/com]
  --localstatedir=DIR    modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
  --libdir=DIR           object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
  --includedir=DIR       C header files [PREFIX/include]
  --oldincludedir=DIR    C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]
  --infodir=DIR          info documentation [PREFIX/info]
  --mandir=DIR           man documentation [PREFIX/man]

System types:
  --build=BUILD     configure for building on BUILD [guessed]
  --host=HOST       cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST [BUILD]
  --target=TARGET   configure for building compilers for TARGET [HOST]

  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-as-needed              Link libperl against Net-SNMP libraries
                                  rather than applications. We recommend to
                                  use this option if it works.
  --enable-silent-libtool         Pass --silent to libtool.

  --enable-debugging              Outputs extra debugging information at all
                                  times.  Normally, you should not enable this,
                                  but instead use the -D flag of the commands,
                                  which toggles debuging output at runtime.
  --disable-debugging             Disallows debugging code to be built in.
                                  This might provide some speed benefits.
  --enable-developer              Turns on super-duper-extra-compile-warnings

                                  configure to abort (default is to issue a
                                  warning and continue.)
  --enable-mib-config-debug       Turns on verbose output during mib module
                                  configure processing.)

  --enable-testing-code           Enables some code sections that should
                                  only be used for testing of certain
                                  SNMP functionalities.  This should *not*
                                  be turned on for production use.  Ever.
  --enable-reentrant              Enables locking functions that protect
                                  library resources in some multi-threading
                                  environments.  This does not guarantee
                                  thread-safe operation.
                                  Currently an experimental setting.

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)

Compiler Options:
  --with-cc=CC                    use CC to compile (default=gcc).

  --with-linkcc=CC                use CC to link (default=gcc).
  --with-ar=AR                    use AR as the archiver.
  --with-endianness=big|little    define endianness of target platform when
                                  cross-compiling.

  --with-install-prefix=PATH      Just for installing, prefix all
                                  directories with PATH.  This is known not
                                  to work on some systems with shared
                                  libraries (eg, HPUX)

  --with-dmalloc=PATH             Use dmalloc library (www.dmalloc.com)
  --with-efence                   Look for and use libefence (malloc).

  --without-opaque-special-types  Don't use special opaque encodings.
                                  SNMP normally cannot handle
                                  floating numbers, nor large 64 bit
                                  integers well.  By default, the
                                  net-snmp package compiles in
                                  support for these extra datatypes
                                  (in a legal way)
  --with-mibdirs=\"dir1:dir2:\"   Default directories to look for mibs.

                                  (The default list is \"IP-MIB:IF-MIB:
                                  TCP-MIB:UDP-MIB:SNMPv2-MIB:RFC1213-MIB\"
                                  with the addition of any mibs used
                                  by the mib modules the agent is
                                  configured with)
  --with-mibfiles=\"file1:file2\" Default mib files to load.
                                  (Default:  none.  uses IDs above instead.)
  --with-pkcs=PATH                Look for pkcs11 in PATH/lib.

Configuring the agent:
  --without-root-access           The snmpd agent won't require root access to
                                  run it.  The information it returns in the
                                  mib-II tree may not be correct, however.
  --without-kmem-usage            Do not include any code related to the use
                                  of kmem.

                                  the necessary information is not available.
                                  This is technically not compliant with the
                                  SNMP specifications, but was how the agent
                                  operated for versions < 4.0.

                                     (or use \"yes\" to copy them).
                                     (Default: yes)
  --with-agentx-socket=FILE         AgentX socket (Default: /var/agentx/master as specified in RFC2741)

  --with-sys-contact=\"who@where\"  Default system contact.
                                    (Default: LOGIN@DOMAINNAME)
  --with-sys-location=\"location\"  Default system location.
                                    (Default: Unknown)

                                     (default .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.4 =
                                      "netSnmpNotificationPrefix")

Perl:
  --with-perl-modules=ARGS      Install the Perl modules along with the rest
                                  of the net-snmp toolkit.  If ARGS is
                                  specified, they're passed to the
                                  Makefile.PL script.

Python:
  --with-python-modules=ARGS    Install the python bindings along with the
                                  rest of the net-snmp toolkit.  If ARGS is
                                  specified, they're passed to the
                                  setup.py script as arguments.

Network Buffers:
  --with-server-send-buf=ARG    Use ARG for the default UDP/TCP send buffer instead
                                  of the OS buffer for server sockets that are
                                  created (snmpd, snmptrapd).
                                  This default can be overridden in the runtime
                                  configuration files.
                                  The ARG should be the size in bytes
  --with-server-recv-buf=ARG    Similar as previous option, but for receive buffer
  --with-client-send-buf=ARG    Similar as previous options, but for the
                                  receive buffer of client sockets
  --with-client-recv-buf=ARG    Similar as previous options, but for the send buffer

Miscellaneous:
  --with-defaults         Use defaults for prompted values.
  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
  --with-pic              try to use only PIC/non-PIC objects [default=use
                          both]
  --with-tags[=TAGS]
                          include additional configurations [automatic]
  --without-elf           use elf libraries
  --with-libwrap=LIBPATH  Compile in libwrap (tcp_wrappers) support.
  --with-zlib=DIR         use libz in DIR
  --with-bzip2=DIR        use libbz2 in DIR

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor
  CXX         C++ compiler command
  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
  CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
  F77         Fortran 77 compiler command
  FFLAGS      Fortran 77 compiler flags

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
