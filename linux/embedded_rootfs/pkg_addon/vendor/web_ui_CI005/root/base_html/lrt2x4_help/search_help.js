var SearchVar1_1="Introduction of LRT214/LRT224 Gigabit VPN Router";
var SearchVar1_2="Thank you for choosing the product. The Linksys VPN Routers for Small Business";
var SearchVar1_3="includes two models: LRT214 Gigabit VPN Router and LRT224 Dual-WAN Gigabit Router.Both models support site-to-site VPN, which allows branch offices to connect with the central office, and client-to-site VPN, which allows employees to securely connect back to their offices while they are away. The dual-WAN model supports WAN Failover, which allows a business to continue its network operation when one of its WAN connections to the Internet fails. With dual-WAN load balancing, the dual-WAN model can aggregate the bandwidths of both WAN connections to achieve a higher Internet bandwidth than what a single WAN connection can provide.";
var SearchVar1_4="In response to the growing demand of giving employees remote access to the IT resources in their offices using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, the products support OpenVPN server, which allows OpenVPN clients running on employees¡¯ laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the offices using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication typically requires pre-installed certificates as part of the authentication of an OpenVPN connection, in addition to username/password, for additional security.";
var SearchVar1_5="The products come with an integrated firewall that supports URL filtering and access rules that allow administrator to further regulate the traffic within the business network based on the services (i.e. TCP/UDP ports) and source/destination IP addresses.";
var SearchVar1_6="To work with modern wireless access points that support multiple SSIDs, typically used to support guest VLAN, the products support 802.1q (VLAN tagging), which provides separation between resources in different SSIDs/VLANs. With inter-VLAN routing, the products allow specified traffic to traverse between VLANs. In order to work in different environments as ISPs transition from IPv4 to IPv6 in their access networks, the products support dual stack IPv4 and IPv6 as well as transition technologies such as 6to4 and 6rd.";
var SearchVar1_7="Like other Linksys routers, the products have an intuitive Web administrative interface that allows small business owners to deploy and manage the routers without professional IT staff onsite. The operational heath of the products can be monitored through system logs and email alerts. Standard MIBs are supported, which allows the products to be monitored by a SNMP-based network management system.";
