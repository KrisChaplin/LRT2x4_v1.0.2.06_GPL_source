Basic System Preparation:
________________________

Step 1:
        Install the above packages in standard binary directories. If compiled
        from source use "prefix=/" as parameter for the configure script.
                Note: If you have other software installed in the system that
                      are dependent on the original version of the above
                      packages they may not work. To avoid problems, please
                      use a dedicated development machine.


Step 2: Provide setuid permissions for pppd.
                chmod ugo+s /usr/sbin/pppd

Step 3: Add user with nologin permission, called "nobody" and group "nobody".

Step 4: As EasyAccess doesnt support dhcp, it is adviced to provide static
        IP Address to the devlopment machine. Also it best adviced to name
        the host as "firebase".

Step 5: Apply the MCCP Kernel patch, recompile the kernel and use it as
        development environment.
                Note: This is not must. If kernel is not compiled with MCCP,
                compression wont be enabled for Virtual Passage.

Step 6: Copy the EasyAccess source code to a non-home directory. 
        It is suggested to use /usr/local/src/EasyAccess. 

Step 7: Make sure there is no other HTTP Server active in the system.

Step 8: Modify /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit script to launch /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.
        /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall will be created by EasyAccess sofware during
        installation.
                Add the following line 
                                /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall start

        Note: If there is any firewall currently configured, please disable
        them.

Step 9: Modify /etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/ppp/ip-down scripts.
                Add the following line to /etc/ppp/ip-up
                        /etc/ppp/ip-up.local $@

                Add the following line to /etc/ppp/ip-down
                        /etc/ppp/ip-down.local $@

                For IPV6 Virtual Passage:
                Modify the following line in /etc/ppp/ipv6-up
                        [ -x /etc/ppp/ipv6-up.local ] && /etc/ppp/ipv6-up.local "$@"
                to
                        [ -x /etc/ppp/ip6-up.local ] && /etc/ppp/ip6-up.local "$@"

                Modify the following line in /etc/ppp/ipv6-down
                        [ -x /etc/ppp/ipv6-down.local ] && /etc/ppp/ipv6-down.local "$@"
                to
                        [ -x /etc/ppp/ip6-down.local ] && /etc/ppp/ip6-down.local "$@"
                        

Step 10: Setup the Menlo Logic suggested kernel runtime parameters. This can
         be done by copying sysctl.conf to /etc/sysctl.conf.
                sysctl -p will activate the kernel runtime parameters.

Step 11: Create openssl.conf in /etc/ssl/ with required parmeters
         

Note: Before proceeding further, re-boot the machine in development kernel.

How to compile and run EasyAccess:
___________________________________

        1) From the EasyAccess directory, run these commands
                ./Configure --enable-md5-session --enable-optimization
                make
                make install

        2) During make install, you will prompted for self signed certificate
        parameters. Please refer to OpenSSL documentation for valid field
        values.

        3) If you wish to use http proxy written in C, use the configure 
           option --use-c-proxy. Before compiling EasyAccess, create
           autoconfig options for libxml2 and pcrs located in
           EasyAccess/src/httprp/[libxml2, pcrs]. Both libxml2 and pcrs
           are standard version of the software, with few custom
           modifications.

        4) Include EasyAccess Libraries into default ld cache.
                a) Add the following line to /etc/ld.so.conf
                        /usr/local/src/EasyAccess/bin
                b) Rebuild the cache using the following command
                        ldconfig -c /etc/ld.so.conf

        5) From EasyAccess/bin directory, launch the system using
                EasyAccessCtr start

        6) Point your browser to the ipaddress of the host.
                Note: Loopback adress wont work. This is disabled for
                security.

        7) Default login is "admin", password is "admin123".

        Please refer to guides from Menlo Logic for configuration and usage.

                     *************************************
Note:

1) For Editing and viewing the software, use the vimrc included with EasyAccess
and vim editor.

2) To compile with IPv6 support, use --enable-ipv6 option with the configure
script. When this flag is used, the included CAVIUM HTTP Server is used 
instead of Apache. IPv6 support in EasyAccess is dependant on the support for
IPv6 available in the kernel.
