<h4><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->EasyAccess 
 Overview</h4>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">EasyAccess SSL VPN provides 
 secure remote access to network resources, such as applications, files, 
 Intranet web sites, and email, through a web browser or through client 
 software, such as Microsoft Outlook. The underlying protocol used for 
 these sessions is SSL.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">With SSL VPN, mobile workers, 
 telecommuters, partners and customers can access information and applications 
 on your Intranet or Extranet. What information should be accessible to 
 the user is determined by access policies configured by the EasyAccess 
 administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px;
			margin-left: 0px;
			font-weight: bold;">Remote resources can be accessed in the 
 following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using a standard web browser -</span> To access 
 network resources, you must log into the EasyAccess SSL VPN portal. Once 
 authenticated, you may access Intranet HTTP and HTTPS sites, web-based 
 applications, and web-based email. In addition, you may upload and download 
 files using FTP or Windows Network File Sharing. All access is performed 
 through a standard web browser and does not require any client applications 
 to be downloaded to remote users’ machines.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Java thin-client access to corporate desktops 
 and applications –</span> EasyAccess includes several Java or ActiveX 
 thin-client programs that can be launched from within the SSL VPN portal. 
 Terminal Services and VNC Java clients allow remote users to access corporate 
 servers and desktops, open files, edit and store data as if they were 
 at the office. In addition, Terminal Services provides the unique ability 
 to open individual applications and support remote sound and print services. 
 In addition, users may access Telnet and SSH servers from the SSL VPN 
 portal.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using the Virtual Passage SSL VPN client –</span> 
 EasyAccess includes an ActiveX-based SSL VPN client for Window users and 
 a Java based client for Mac users that provides full network connectivity. 
 To connect using the SSL VPN client, log into the portal, download the 
 installer application and then launch the Virtual Passage connector to 
 establish the SSL VPN tunnel. Once you have set up a VPN connection, you 
 can access network resources as if you were on the local network.</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using native application software</span> <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">on the remote computer –</span> EasyAccess 
 SSL VPN includes a TCP Tunneling feature that allows users to connect 
 to servers on the network from SSL-enabled applications such as Microsoft 
 Outlook, Outlook Express, and Internet Explorer. To connect to a remote 
 server, you just need to launch client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, 
 Outlook Express, IBM Lotus Notes or Netscape Mail. Your client software 
 will automatically try to contact the remote server, transparently authenticate 
 using the settings that you have defined in the client. The EasyAccess 
 SSL VPN gateway device will receive the request made by the client. The 
 EasyAccess SSL VPN gateway will then forward the request to an internal 
 network server. Then you can download and send emails, download Lotus 
 Notes calendar information, or access other application servers securely.</p></li>
