How to create Certificate store for signing Java Code from (.spc) and (.pvk) files
__________________________________________________________________________________

Step 1:
	On a Windows machine install the tool "pvkimprt".
	
Step 2:
	Import the certificate into a known location using pvkimprt <.spc filename> <.pvk filename>.

Step 3:
	Start->Run->mmc
	On the main window click "Console->Add/Remove Snap-in".Choose Certificates and select the 
	certificate imported in Step 2.

Step 4:
	Right click on the selected certificate and chose "properties" and give a friendly name that 
	will server as our <alias> (e.g. mycertalias)

Step 5:
	From the Actions drop down select Export and export the certificate imported in Step 2.The 
	exported file will get saved as .pfx file.
	
Step 6:
	Import the .pfx file from Mozilla/Firefox browser through Edit->Preferences->Advanced->
	Certificates->Manage Certificates into "Your Certificates".This would import the contents of 
	the .pfx file into the Browser's certificate store.
	
Step 7:
	Export the certificate imported in Step 6, by clicking on "Backup".This file should have 
	a .p12 extension.
	
	This is the certificate store that is to be used for signing Java Code.
