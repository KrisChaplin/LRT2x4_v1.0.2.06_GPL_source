1.While clearing the  History, In CleanURL History function was not able to trace subfolder since it crashes,

if return value of IEnumDList is success it should be checked to NOERROR, we didnt check it as 	while 

While (hr == NOERROR) previously it was while (SUCCEEDED(hr)) so that it was not able to trace the subfolder.

2.In all the functions data mismatch was there between conversion of ASCII to Unicode.By passing proper data Bugs has been fixed.
And also return value is not checked in certain cases.
