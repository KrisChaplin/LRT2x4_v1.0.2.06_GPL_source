Thu Jun 23 2005: 1.2.20
  * New Features - None
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed memory overrun problem while preparing the request to be sent to
      the backend web server.
    - Fixed memory leak of cev values returned by xml (escape and unescaped
      strings)
    - Fixed memory overrun probelm in cookie handling; After getting list of
      cookies from httprp_get_cookies(), we would overrun authorization
      header by one byte by adding a space.
    - Fixed handling of invalid authreqd cookie set by client without any
      content
    - base64 and md5 auth encoding will now get unescaped strings, which
      generate the correct hash for username:realm:password
    - Rewrite of SSL connection, session caching, and termination.
    - Included gdbm object lib for SSL session stores.

Fri Jun 17 2005: 1.2.19
  * New Features - None

      than combining with location with quotes.

Thu Jun 16 2005: 1.2.18
  * New Features - None
  * Bug Fixes
    - OWA Calendar Availability Status and Public Folders access fixed.
      This fix also includes a new way of handling OWA - User Agent cookie
      is now set to handle the user agent modification throughout the session.
    - Included + symbol in DO-NOT-ESCAPE list while escaping URLs.

Wed Jun 15 2005: 1.2.17
  * New Features
    - Added exception handling mechanism for regexp matches. Users can now add
      a new exception to an existing match so that a match can be discarded
      allowing to custom match expressions. This is mainly for regex matches
      within a javascript segment.
  * Bug Fixes
    - If header is not received, then we assume that the status of the response
      is OK, and the response is parsed as text/html.
    - Fixed path append to urls with file or query strings. Prior to this even
      a potential file would be appended to the base string in all URL
      rewrites. Fixed in html rewrite, js full url and css full url.
    - .domain rewrites implemented to solve JS security errors like
      "Access is denied", "Invalid Arguments", etc.

Sun Jun 12 2005: 1.2.16
  * New Features
    - Added regexps to handle hrefs within scripts.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed bug where reverse proxy used to crash because, we were trying to
      free WWW-Authenticate header's info.
    - Content-length will not be set in the response to be sent to the
      client if we are processing a status 100 response.
      A status 100 response might contain an addition response from the backend
      server which has to be processed too. This might arrive in the single
      read() from the backend server.
    - OWA Fix: no translation for URL's pointing to schemas on microsoft.com
    - OWA Fix: USER_AGENT string of MSIE will now be changed to look like an
      IE 4.0 string so that we enter a compatibility mode.
    - We do not add implied html, head and body tags in to the document.
      Sometimes libxml calls us with implied elements.
    - URL rewrite will not exclude url values starting with fragments, as
      they will point to a bookmark within the same page.

Wed Jun 08 2005: 1.2.15
  * New Features - None
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed HTTPS, iframe, src and IE bug : where IE thinks an iframe without
      a src element or a src element with empty value is a page from an
      insecure site.
    - Fixed common_js_regexp:location or location.: where an if condition would
      also be modified. For e.g. if (location.protocol == 'http') etc.
    - Fixed common_js_regexp: open: where something like
      window.open(somearray[somefunc()] would be replaced wrongly.

Mon May 09 2005:
	* httprp_html.c, Makefile
	  Added REGEX support to replace PCRE usage.
	* Fixed some compilation warnings which was discovered while using
	  gcc 3.4 on FC3.
	* httprp.c
	  Fixed fpout check in httprp_debug_write_response().

Jan 24, 2005:
        * httrp_html.c
          a) Fixed the bug of adding base url to relative url's starting with '/'
             in function httprp_htmltag_rewrite_url. As a result the if condition
             is expanded to check if the url starts with https, http and '/'.

Sun Nov 15 00:24:00 2004:
	* httprp_buf.h
	  a) Increased the debug buffer len from 1000 to 2000, so that big
	     cookies could be debugged in syslog
	* httprp.c
	  a) Fixed the bug of not reading the QUERY_STRING CEV in
	     httprp_get_urlelements(). As a result, no links could be navigated
	     in yahoo or msn. Also removed unncessary #if 0 code in the
	     function.
	  b) httprp_hdrparse_set_cookie() added domain support for set-cookie
	     header. Since domain support was not there, cookies wer not being
	     stored, and hence mail.yahoo.com was not visible.
	* httprp_cgi.c
	  a) httprp_get_cookies() : added support for retrieving domain level
	     cookies.
	* httprp.h
	  a) Added HTTPRP_SCDOMAIN_STR
	* httprp_html.c
	  a) fullurl function is being written after the title endtag call.
	  b) httprp_parse_embedded_javascript() : http://localhost substitution
	     and the same for https:// - Added one more job for https
	* httprp_nc.c
	  a) Added session_cache compile time option. At this time, yahoo mail
	     doesn't work with session_cache enabled
	* makefile
	  a) Added compile time defines
	  
Tue Oct 19 01:55:00 2004:
	Release 0.4-3 
	* Sorry, could not document all the changes since the last documented
	  release.
	* Fixed bugs seen on Friday, while trying to browse sun.com
	* split the sprintf() of cev http req header in form_request()
	  cev_modval and cev_val are now memcpy'd in to the request buffer,
	  rather than a sprintf() since the string is not '\0' terminated.
	* use of strncasecmp() instead of just strncmp() while matching
	  headers received in http response, in httprp_parse_http_header()

Tue Aug 23 02:42:00 2004:
	Release 0.1-1 
	* httprp_html.h, httprp_html.c: Modified <base> handling, and URL's
	  which are based on <base>
	* httprp.c: Added "Connection: close\r\n" header
	  [Issue 1]
	* httprp_cgi.c: Added httprp_req_referer_handler() in the CGI Var
	  handling

Tue Aug 22 21:06:35 2004:
	Release 0.1
	* First code drop.
