<h4>&nbsp;EasyAccess SSL VPN Overview</h4>

<p class=whs1>SSL VPN allows applications and private network resources 
 to be accessed remotely through a secure SSL connection. Using SSL VPN, 
 mobile workers, business partners, and customers can access files or applications 
 on a company’s extranet or within a private local area network. </p>

<p class=whs1>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=whs1>Although SSL VPN products are described as clientless, the 
 typical SSL VPN portal combines web, Java and ActiveX components that 
 are downloaded from the SSL VPN portal transparently, allowing users to 
 connect to a remote network without needing to manually install and configure 
 a VPN client application. In addition, SSL VPN enables users to connect 
 from a variety of devices, including Windows, UNIX and Linux PCs and Internet 
 enabled PDAs and smartphones. </p>

<p class=whs1>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=whs1>The Menlo Logic EasyAccess SSL VPN software provides an 
 end-to-end SSL VPN solution. It includes a web based management interface 
 that can configure SSL VPN users, access policies, authentication methods, 
 user bookmarks for network resources, and system settings.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px;

 resources can be accessed in the following ways:</span></p>

<p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using a standard web browser -</span> To access 
 network resources, you must log into the EasyAccess SSL VPN portal. Once 
 authenticated, you may access Intranet HTTP and HTTPS sites, web-based 
 applications, and web-based email. In addition, you may upload and download 
 files using FTP or Windows Network File Sharing. All access is performed 
 through a standard web browser and does not require any client applications 
 to be downloaded to remote users’ machines.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Java thin-client access to corporate desktops 
 and applications –</span> EasyAccess includes several Java or ActiveX 
 thin-client programs that can be launched from within the SSL VPN portal. 
 Terminal Services and VNC Java clients allow remote users to access corporate 
 servers and desktops, open files, edit and store data as if they were 
 at the office. In addition, Terminal Services provides the unique ability 
 to open individual applications and support remote sound and print services. 
 In addition, users may access Telnet and SSH servers from the SSL VPN 
 portal.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using the Virtual Passage SSL VPN client –</span> 
 EasyAccess includes an ActiveX-based SSL VPN client for Window users 
 and a Java based client for Mac users that provides full network connectivity. 
 To connect using the SSL VPN client, log into the portal, download the 
 installer application and then launch the Virtual Passage connector to 
 establish the SSL VPN tunnel. Once you have set up a VPN connection, you 
 can access network resources as if you were on the local network.</p></li>
</ul>

	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-right: 49px; margin-left: 0px;"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Using native application software</span> <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">on the remote computer –</span> EasyAccess 
 SSL VPN includes a TCP Tunneling feature that allows users to connect 
 to servers on the network from SSL-enabled applications such as Microsoft 
 Outlook, Outlook Express, and Internet Explorer. To connect to a remote 
 server, you just need to launch client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, 
 Outlook Express, IBM Lotus Notes or Netscape Mail. Your client software 
 will automatically try to contact the remote server, transparently authenticate 
 using the settings that you have defined in the client. The EasyAccess 
 SSL VPN gateway device will receive the request made by the client. The 
 EasyAccess SSL VPN gateway will then forward the request to an internal 
 network server. Then you can download and send emails, download Lotus 
 Notes calendar information, or access other application servers securely.</p></li>
