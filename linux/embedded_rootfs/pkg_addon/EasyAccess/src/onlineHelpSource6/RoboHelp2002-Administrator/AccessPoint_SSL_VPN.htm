<h4>&nbsp;EasyAccess Overview</h4>

<p class=whs1>SSL VPN allows applications and private network resources 
 to be accessed remotely through a secure SSL connection. Using SSL VPN, 
 mobile workers, business partners, and customers can access files or applications 
 on a company’s extranet or within a private local area network. </p>

<p class=whs1><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p class=whs1>EasyAccess provides an array of options to allow remote users 
 to access the resources they need. Ranging from completely clientless 
 access of web, FTP and Windows Network Neighborhood to a full VPN tunnel, 
 EasyAccess provides the required SSL VPN features for all users. ActiveX 
 components that are downloaded from the SSL VPN portal transparently, 
 allowing users to connect to a remote network without needing to manually 
 install and configure a VPN client application. In addition, SSL VPN enables 
 users to connect from a variety of devices, including Windows, UNIX and 
 Linux PCs and Internet enabled PDAs and smartphones. </p>

<p class=whs1><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p class=whs1>The EasyAccess SSL VPN software provides an end-to-end SSL 
 VPN solution. It includes a web based management interface that can configure 
 SSL VPN users, access policies, authentication methods, user bookmarks 
 for network resources, and system settings.</p>

<p class=whs1>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=whs2>Remote network resources can be accessed in the following 
 ways:</p>

<p class=whs1>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class=whs3
	style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-Cwhs1><p class=whs1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using 
 a standard web browser -</span> To access network resources, you must 
 log into the EasyAccess SSL VPN portal. Once authenticated, you may access 
 Intranet HTTP and HTTPS sites, web-based applications, and web-based email. 
 In addition, you may upload and download files using FTP or Windows Network 
 File Sharing. All access is performed through a standard web browser and 
 does not require any client applications to be downloaded to remote users’ 
 machines.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-Cwhs1><p class=whs1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java 
 thin-client access to corporate desktops and applications –</span> EasyAccess 
 includes several Java or ActiveX thin-client programs that can be launched 
 from within the SSL VPN portal. Terminal Services and VNC Java clients 
 allow remote users to access corporate servers and desktops, open files, 
 edit and store data as if they were at the office. In addition, Terminal 
 Services provides the unique ability to open individual applications and 
 support remote sound and print services. In addition, users may access 
 Telnet and SSH servers from the SSL VPN portal.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-Cwhs1><p class=whs1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using 
 the Virtual Passage SSL VPN client –</span> EasyAccess includes an ActiveX-based 
 SSL VPN client for Window users and a Java based client for Mac users 
 that provides full network connectivity. To connect using the SSL VPN 
 client, log into the portal, download the installer application and then 
 launch the Virtual Passage connector to establish the SSL VPN tunnel. 
 Once you have set up a VPN connection, you can access network resources 
 as if you were on the local network.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-Cwhs1><p class=whs1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using 
 Virtual Transport for TCP application support –</span> EasyAccess SSL 
 VPN includes Virtual Transport, an ActiveX client that allows users to 
 connect to TCP servers. Virtual Transport is similar to Virtual Passage, 
 but it is a lighter client that only encrypts and tunnels individual TCP 
 applications to the corporate network. It does not create a full VPN tunnel 
 like Virtual Passage, so it can reduce the bandwidth consumed by remote 
 users and can support more fine grained policy management.</p></li>
