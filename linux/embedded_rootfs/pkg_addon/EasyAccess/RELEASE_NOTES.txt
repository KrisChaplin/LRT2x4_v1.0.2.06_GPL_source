ftp (FTP Session Management):
       * New Features - None
       * Bug Fixes
         - FTP  file  listing not working for some ftp server settings - MS-DOS
           Style. (89)
       * Other
         - Documentation:  File  download  window  prompts twice for file open.
           This is default IE behavior, and cannot be fixed. (110)

httpd (Web Server):
       * New Features
         - Support for client certificates in httpd. (287)
       * Bug Fixes
         - Fixed issues in un-escaping URI's
           (314, 315, 316, 317, 327, 359, 360, 361, 362)
         - Tunnel  closure  is  now  handled  properly by properly closing the
           correct  fd  and  preserving  the  SSL  context  until  the  entire
           connection is freed. (395, 420)
         - A  general  httpd  problem seen while handling POST requests is now
           fixed.  The exec()'ed  CGI was not able to read the buffer in stdin
           because of non-closure on httpd side. (408)
         - SSL  Connections  in httpd were accept()'ed with an assumption that
           the accept()  will  always  return  immediately.  This has now been
           changed by adding a HTTPD_ACCEPT_PENDING state,  and the daemon now
           handles accept() attempts as part of the httpd state machine.
           This fix solves the issue of: "HTTPD does not respond when accessed
           Mozilla-1.0.1". (419)
         - File-descriptor / pipe  leaks  in  GET  request processing has been
           fixed. (422)
         - Incorrect  closure  of  the  connection file-descriptor  in the per
           connection handling structure,  caused  multiple  connections  from
           Virtual Transport to fail. (263, 421)
         - Copying  of  remote and local ip addresses in to the per-connection
           structure  was  done  with  length  out  of  bounds,  resulting  in
           segmentation faults. (427)
         - Rewrite  Engine  in  httpd  fails  in  some  cases  to redirect the
           Requested URL to httprp. (429)
         - Support for MacOS 10.4 Tiger clients. (288)
         - Added mime type application/x-bzip2 for files ending with extension
           bz2.  This was done to fix the MacOS VP Installation and connection
           discovered while testing MacOS VP client with httpd. (457)
       * Other - None

httprp (Reverse Proxy):
       * New Features - None
       * Bug Fixes
         - Import statement in CSS translated properly (140)
         - Path  and  Domain  attributes of  Set-Cookie have been handled in a
           case-insensitive manner. (172)
         - HTML  tag attributes are now rewritten as per the case found in the
           original web content received from the backend web server. (173)
         - Regular  expression  to  parse  window.location  statements  within
           embedded and inline javascripts have been fixed. (177)
         - URI path parsing and translation has been fixed to support download
           of  content  from   sub-directories  within  the  web  server  root
           directory. (201, 202, 203, 212)
         - Request  Protocol  regular  expressions have been fixed. These bugs
           are  related to  content  not being displayed on browser because of
           incorrect protocol translations. (217)
         - CSS links/reference to other style-sheets starting with '#' symbols
           i.e.  references  to  bookmarks   within  the  same  page  are  not
           translated anymore. (309, 310, 312)
         - HTML  Tags with attributes without explicit Javascript statement to
           indicate  that  the  tag  refers  to a Javascript statement are now
           being  translated  correctly.  These  changes also fix the bug when
           httprp  crashes  when a page with base tag present and CSS urls are
           present. (311, 388)
         - HTML  Tag  "option"  and  attribute  "value" is now being parsed to
           check if the value has any urls.
           URLs are translated in these cases. (358, 414)
         - Javascript Translation fixes
           - Translation   of  location.href   statements  within  inline  and
             embedded javascripts have been fixed. (126, 413)
           - Translation  of  javascript  statements  with location, href, and
             window properties and methods  have  been  fixed to recognize the
             different combination of single-quote and double-quote.
             (319, 320, 321, 323, 324, 325, 326, 328, 329, 330, 332, 333, 334,
              335, 336, 337, 332, 339, 340, 344, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351,
              364, 365, 367, 369, 370, 371)
         - HTTP  Header  de-limiter  recognition  and  processing has now been
           changed to accept the following combinations - "\r\n", "\n".
           Delimiter of the header  portion  itself can now be parsed with the
           following combinations - "\r\n\r\n", "\n\n" (345)
         - Crash seen while handling escaped cookies is now fixed. (381)
         - An  interim  solution  to handle large content coming from  backend
           web  server  is  provided  by  simply  increasing  the  size of the
           incoming  response  buffer  to  512K.  This  is an interim solution
           until the reverse proxy module is made more scaleable. (382)
         - HTML  Entities starting from 'fnof' until 'diams' were not included
           in the encoding process in libxml2. This is now included. (386)
         - Script  statements/reference  within document.write bodies were not
           being handled.  As a result some  javascripts referenced within the
           src tag was not downloaded by the browsers. (412)
         - Values  for  attributes  of tags compulsorily prefixed and suffixed
           with quotes.  This behaviour is now  changed to include quotes only
           if the original content has quotes. (415)
         - Inserting  end  of  tags  is  fixed  and  may  differ from original
           content. This default behaviour is now changed to recognize how the
           tag is closed in the original content, and is reflected in the
           translated content. (416)
         - Outlook Web Access (OWA)
           - When  "Options"  page  is  clicked in OWA, an javascript error on
             invalid object used to come up. (198)
           - When  "Manage Junk E-mail Lists"  within  "Options"  was clicked,
             a  javascript  error  "Object  does  not support this property or
             method" used to show up. (200)
         - Microsoft Sharepoint Support
           - Alignment  of  left  navigation  menu has been fixed with correct
             translation. (309)
           - Few  tags  required for parsing Sharepoint content, which are not
             part  of  the standard HTML tags definition are added. (313, 318)
         - Miscellaneous Bug Fixes
           - Errors in translation of content from Google website.
             (204, 205, 206)
           - Errors in translation of content from Yahoo Sites. (233)

           Active Directory  uses  Kerberos  protocol. Kerberos works on token
           exchange  mechanism. It  is  not  like  a  simple admission control
           mechanism like user-id/password. Kerberos  authenticates a user for
           a  certain time  period, after that the client should  authenticate
           again. Clock between the client and server should in perfect synch,
           if not kerberos will not work, should not work. EasyAccess and 2003
           server must be in clock sync.

Cavium has changed the following features from the previous release:
        * libxml2 has been moved to EasyAccess/3rdParty.
        * C based HttpRP is now the default HTTP Proxy. Configure
          option '--use-c-proxy' is removed.

          to disable trusted root certificate validation.
        * libSys is optimized for CN2xx. 
                - All the CGI clients that use clientApi must call
                  initClientApi().
        * TLV parameters are changed.
        * AAA libauth is enabled by default in SOHO.
        * libgcgi now has a simpler wrapper, getCookie(), that wraps
          all the common CGI operations like initCgi() and fetchCookie().
        * Unused code in libgcgi is wrapped under EXPANDED_FEATURES
        * WebFTP is enabled by default for CN22xx builds. 
        * userLogin is removed from single_cgi and it is now 
          a stand alone CGI.
