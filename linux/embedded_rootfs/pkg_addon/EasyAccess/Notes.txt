Version Specific Notes:

1.2.6, Feb 26, 2005:
-------------------
        Virtual Passage had quite a few changes, This required additional
        platform modifications,
                * HDLC frame encoding is added to maintain packet integrity. n_hdlc
                  must be included in the kernel. If n_hdlc is compiled as module
                  update modules.conf.
                * Virtual Passage driver and dialer name has been changed to avoid
                  using Menlo Logic name. This will require manual un-installation of
                  the driver from the system.
