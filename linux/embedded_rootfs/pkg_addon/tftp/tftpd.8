IPv4 Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm in.tftpd
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl u Ar userid
.Op Fl r Ar option...
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server which supports the
.Tn DARPA
Trivial File Transfer
Protocol.
The
.Tn TFTP
server operates
at the port indicated in the
.Ql tftp
service description;
see
.Xr services 5 .
The server is normally started by
.Xr inetd 8 .
.Pp
The use of
.Xr tftp 1
does not require an account or password on the remote system.
Due to the lack of authentication information,
.Nm
will allow only publicly readable files to be
accessed.
Files may be written only if they already exist and are publicly writable.
Note that this extends the concept of
.Dq public
to include
all users on all hosts that can be reached through the network;
this may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications
should be considered before enabling tftp service.
The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege
(see the
.Fl u
flag below.)
.Pp
Access to files may be restricted by invoking
.Nm
with a list of directories by including pathnames
as server program arguments in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf .
In this case access is restricted to files whose
names are prefixed by the one of the given directories.
.Pp
If the
.Fl c
flag is used,
.Nm
will allow new files to be created; otherwise uploaded files must already
exist.  Files are created with default permissions allowing anyone to read
or write to them.
.Pp
When using the
.Fl s
flag with a directory name,
.Nm
will
.Xr chroot 2
on startup; therefore the remote host is not expected to pass the
directory as part of the file name to transfer.  This option is
recommended for security, as well as compatibility with boot ROMs
which do not include a directory name.
.Pp
The
.Fl u
flag can be used to specify a user ID which
.Nm
will run as; the default is ``nobody''.
.Pp
This version of
.Nm
supports RFC 2347 option negotiation; the current version supports the
.Pa blksize
(RFC 2348),
.Pa tsize ,
(RFC 2349), and
.Pa timeout
(RFC 2349) options.  The
.Fl r
flag can be used to disable options individually; this may allow
working around client bugs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tftp 1 ,
.Xr inetd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
The
.Fl s
flag appeared in NetBSD 0.9a.
.Pp
The
.Fl c
flag was added in OpenBSD 2.1 .
.Pp
The
.Fl r
flag and RFC 2347 options were added by H. Peter Anvin based on
patches by Markus Gutschke and Gero Kulhman.
.Pp
The
.Fl u
flag was added by H. Peter Anvin.
