WHAT IS NLS?
------------
NLS stands for National Language Support. It encompasses the features that make
a program able to support different languages and cultural habits.
This touches the messages displayed on the screen, but also the format used to
display the dates or the numbers for example.


HOW I ENABLE NLS WITH SYSSTAT?
------------------------------
NLS is enabled by default when you configure sysstat (running "./configure").
But you can disable it if you want: Use option "--disable-nls" with
configure or answer 'y' (for 'yes') to the question:
"Disable National Language Support (NLS)? (y/n) [--disable-nls]"
if you use the interactive configuration script (iconfig).


OK, BUT HOW DO I USE IT NOW?
------------------------------
You have to set your LANG environment variable to the proper value.
E.g. in France, you may want to set it to "fr_FR" although other
possibilities exist.

If you use bash and you want to configure your system for a french environment,
enter:

$ export LANG=fr_FR

('$' is the prompt).
If you use the (Tab) C shell, you would have entered:

% setenv LANG fr_FR

('%' is the prompt).
Here is a complete example with iostat:

$ export LANG=en_US
$ iostat -V 
sysstat version 5.1.4

Usage: iostat [ options... ] [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
Options are:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]

$ export LANG=fr_FR
$ iostat -V
sysstat version 5.1.4
(C) Sebastien Godard
Utilisation: iostat [ options... ] [ <intervalle> [ <itérations> ] ]
Options possibles:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]


HOW CAN I ADD A NEW LANGUAGE TO SYSSTAT?
----------------------------------------
At the present time, sysstat is already translated into several languages.
To add another language, use the Portable Object template file
named sysstat.pot located in the nls directory.
Fill it and send it to the Translation Project robot so that your
translation can be included in next sysstat release.
