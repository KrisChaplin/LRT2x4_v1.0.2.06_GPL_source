1.  Overview
    --------

    The strongSwan 4.x branch introduces a new build environment featuring
    GNU autotools. This should simplify the build process and package 
    maintenance.
    First check for the availability of required packages on your system
    (section 2.). You may want to include support for additional features, which
    require other packages to be installed (section 3.).
    To compile an extracted tarball, run the ./configure script first:

      ./configure

    You may want to specify some arguments listed in section 3., or see the
    available options of the script using "./configure --help".

    After a successful run of the script, run

      make

    followed by

      make install

    in the usual manner.

    To check if your kernel fullfills the requirements, see section 4.

    Next add your connections to "/etc/ipsec.conf" and your secrets to 
    "/etc/ipsec.secrets". Connections that are to be negotiated by the new
    IKEv2 charon keying daemon should be designated by "keyexchange=ikev2" and 
    those by the IKEv1 pluto keying daemon either by "keyexchange=ikev1" or
    the default "keyexchange=ike".

    At last start strongSwan with

      ipsec start


2.  Required packages
    -----------------

    In order to be able to build strongSwan you'll need the GNU Multiprecision
    Arithmetic Library (GMP) available from http://www.swox.com/gmp/. At least
    version 4.1.5 of libgmp is required.

    The libgmp library and the corresponding header file gmp.h are usually
    included in the form of one or two packages in the major Linux
    distributions (SuSE: gmp; Debian unstable:  libgmp3, libgmp3-dev).


3.  Optional packages
    -----------------

3.1 libcurl
    -------

    If you intend to dynamically fetch Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
    from an HTTP server or as an alternative want to use the Online
    Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) then you will need the  libcurl library
    available from http://curl.haxx.se/.

    In order to keep the library as compact as possible for use with strongSwan
    you can build libcurl from the sources with the optimized options

       ./configure --prefix=<dir> --without-ssl \
                   --disable-ldap --disable-telnet \
                   --disable-dict --disable-gopher \
                   --disable-debug \
                   --enable-nonblocking --enable-thread

    As an alternative you can use the ready-made packages included with your
    favorite Linux distribution (SuSE: curl, curl-devel).

    In order to activate the use of the libcurl library in strongSwan you must
    enable the ./configure switch:

       ./configure [...] --enable-http


3.2 OpenLDAP
    --------

    If you intend to dynamically fetch Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
    from an LDAP server then you will need the libldap library available
    from http://www.openldap.org/.

    OpenLDAP is usually included  with your Linux distribution. You will need
    both the run-time and development environments (SuSE: openldap2,
    openldap2-devel).

    In order to activate the use of the libldap library in strongSwan you must
    enable the ./configure switch:

       ./configure [...] --enable-ldap

    LDAP Protocl version 2 is not supported anymore, --enable-ldap uses always
    version 3 of the LDAP protocol


3.3 PKCS#11 smartcard library modules
    ---------------------------------

    If you want to securely store your X.509 certificates and private RSA keys
    on a smart card or a USB crypto token then you will need a PKCS #11 library 
    for the smart card of your choice. The OpenSC PKCS#11 library (use
    versions >= 0.9.4) available from http://www.opensc.org/ supports quite a
    selection of cards and tokens (e.g. Aladdin eToken Pro32k, Schlumberger
    Cryptoflex e-gate, Oberthur AuthentIC,  etc.) but requires that a PKCS#15
    directory structure be present on the smart card. But in principle
    any other PKCS#11 library could be used since the PKCS#11 API hides the
    internal data representation on the card.

    For USB crypto token support you must add the OpenCT driver library
    (version >= 0.6.2) from the OpenSC site, whereas for serial smartcard
    readers you'll need the pcsc-lite library and the matching driver from the
    M.U.S.C.L.E project http://www.linuxnet.com/ .

    In order to activate the PKCS#11-based smartcard support in strongSwan
    you must enable the smartcard ./configure switch:

       ./configure [...] --enable-smartcard

    During compilation no externel smart card libraries must be present.
    strongSwan directly references a copy of the standard RSAREF pkcs11.h
    header files stored in the pluto/rsaref sub directory. During compile
    time a pathname to a default PKCS#11 dynamical library can be specified
    with a ./configure flag:

      ./configure --enable-smartcard --with-default-pkcs11=/path/to/lib.so

    This default path to the easily-obtainable OpenSC library module can be
    simply overridden during run-time by specifying an alternative path in
    ipsec.conf pointing to any dynamic PKCS#11 library of your choice.

    config setup
          pkcs11module="/usr/lib/xyz-pkcs11.so"


4.  Kernel configuration
    --------------------

    The strongSwan 4.x series currently support only 2.6 kernels and its
    nativ IPsec stack. Please make sure that the the following IPsec kernel
    modules are available:

      o af_key
      o ah4
      o esp4
      o ipcomp
      o xfrm_user
      o xfrm4_tunnel

    These may be build into the kernel or as modules. Modules get loaded
    automatically at strongSwan startup.

    Also the built-in kernel Cryptoapi modules with selected encryption and
    hash algorithms should be available.
