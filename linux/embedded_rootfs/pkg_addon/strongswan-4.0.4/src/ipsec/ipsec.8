.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ipsec
invokes any of several utilities involved in controlling the IPsec
encryption/authentication system,
running the specified
.I command
with the specified
.IR argument s
as if it had been invoked directly.
This largely eliminates possible name collisions with other software,
and also permits some centralized services.
.PP
The commands
.BR start ,
.BR update ,
.BR reload ,
.BR restart ,
and
.BR stop
are built-in and are used to control the
.BR "ipsec starter"
utility, an extremely fast replacement for the traditional
.BR ipsec
.BR setup
script.
.PP
The commands
.BR up,
.BR down,
.BR route,
.BR unroute,
.BR status,
.BR statusall,
.BR listalgs,
.BR listpubkeys,
.BR listcerts,
.BR listcacerts,
.BR listaacerts,
.BR listocspcerts,
.BR listacerts,
.BR listgroups,
.BR listcainfos,
.BR listcrls,
.BR listocsp,
.BR listcards,
.BR listall,
.BR rereadsecrets,
.BR rereadgroups,
.BR rereadcacerts,
.BR rereadaacerts,
.BR rereadocspcerts,
.BR rereadacerts,
.BR rereadcrls,
and
.BR rereadall
are also built-in and completely replace the corresponding
.BR "ipsec auto"
\-\-\fIoperation\fP"
commands. Communication with the pluto daemon happens via the
.BR "ipsec whack"
socket interface.
.PP
In particular,
.I ipsec
supplies the invoked
.I command
with a suitable PATH environment variable,
and also provides IPSEC_DIR,
IPSEC_CONFS, and IPSEC_VERSION environment variables,
containing respectively
the full pathname of the directory where the IPsec utilities are stored,
the full pathname of the directory where the configuration files live,
and the IPsec version number.
.PP
.B "ipsec start"
calls
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn starts \fIpluto\fR.
.PP
.B "ipsec update"
sends a \fIHUP\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn determines any changes in \fIipsec.conf\fR
and updates the configuration on the running \fIpluto\fR daemon, correspondingly.
.PP
.B "ipsec reload"
sends a \fIUSR1\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn reloads the whole configuration on the running \fIpluto\fR daemon
based on the actual \fIipsec.conf\fR.
.PP
.B "ipsec restart"
executes
.B "ipsec stop"
followed by
.BR "ipsec start".
.PP
.B "ipsec stop"
stops \fIipsec\fR by sending a \fITERM\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter".
.PP
.B "ipsec up"
\fIname\fP tells the \fIpluto\fP daemon to start up connection \fIname\fP.
.PP
.B "ipsec down"
\fIname\fP tells the \fIpluto\fP daemon to take down connection \fIname\fP.
.PP
.B "ipsec route"
\fIname\fP tells the \fIpluto\fP daemon to install a route for connection
\fIname\fP.
.PP
.B "ipsec unroute"
\fIname\fP tells the \fIpluto\fP daemon to take down the route for connection
\fIname\fP.
.PP
.B "ipsec status"
[ \fIname\fP ]  gives concise status information either on connection
\fIname\fP or if the \fIname\fP argument is lacking, on all connections.
.PP
.B "ipsec statusall"
[ \fIname\fP ]  gives detailed status information either on connection
\fIname\fP or if the \fIname\fP argument is lacking, on all connections.
.PP
.B "ipsec listalgs"
returns a list all supported IKE encryption and hash algorithms, the available
Diffie-Hellman groups, as well as all supported ESP encryption and authentication
algorithms.
.PP
.B "ipsec listpubkeys"
returns a list of RSA public keys that were either loaded in raw key format
or extracted from X.509 and|or OpenPGP certificates.
.PP
.B "ipsec listcerts"
returns a list of X.509 and|or OpenPGP certificates that were loaded locally
by the \fIpluto\fP daemon.
.PP
.B "ipsec listcacerts"
returns a list of X.509 Certification Authority (CA) certificates that were
loaded locally by the \fIpluto\fP daemon from the \fI/etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/\fP
directory or received in PKCS#7-wrapped certificate payloads via the  IKE
protocol.
.PP
.B "ipsec listaacerts"
returns a list of X.509 Authorization Authority (AA) certificates that were
loaded locally by the \fIpluto\fP daemon from the \fI/etc/ipsec.d/aacerts/\fP
directory.
.PP
.B "ipsec listocspcerts"
returns a list of X.509 OCSP Signer certificates that were either loaded
locally by the \fIpluto\fP daemon from the \fI/etc/ipsec.d/ocspcerts/\fP
directory or were sent by an OCSP server.
.PP
.B "ipsec listacerts"
returns a list of X.509 Attribute certificates that were loaded locally by
the \fIpluto\fP daemon from the \fI/etc/ipsec.d/acerts/\fP directory.
.PP
.B "ipsec listgroups"
returns a list of groups that are used to define user authorization profiles.
.PP
.B "ipsec listcainfos"
returns certification authority information (CRL distribution points, OCSP URIs,
LDAP servers) that were defined by
.BR ca
sections in \fIipsec.conf\fP.
.PP
.B "ipsec listcrls"
returns a list of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
.PP
.B "ipsec listocsp"

directory and adds them to \fIpluto\fP's list of Authorization Authority (AA) certificates.
.PP
.B "ipsec rereadocspcerts"

for
.IR auto .
.PP
.B "ipsec \-\-version"
outputs version information about Linux strongSwan.
A version code of the form ``U\fIxxx\fR/K\fIyyy\fR''

but the kernel portion appears to be version \fIyyy\fR
(this form is used only if the two disagree).

.PP
.B "ipsec \-\-confdir"

.I ipsec
thinks the IPsec configuration files are stored.
.SH FILES
