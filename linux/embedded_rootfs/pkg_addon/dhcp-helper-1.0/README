This is a simple, straightforward DHCP relay agent which I wrote as
alternative to the ISC relay. 

It's Linux only, but doesn't require any kernel support other than
the network stack. (No LPF or packet sockets.)

If you use this software, please let me know; I would like some idea
if it is generally useful to others.
