version 1.0   Support later versions of the linux capabilities
              ABI. This stops the kernel whingeing.
              Make failure to set capabilities a fatal error, rather
              than silently running as root.
	      Don't attempt to change userid or set capabilities when
              started as a non-root user.

version 0.8   Disable path-MTU discovery, which confuses some clients.
              Add -p option to use alternative ports.
	      Add GPL-v3 as license option.

version 0.7   Tweak transmit code so that MAC addresses >14 bytes
	      are handled as broadcasts.

version 0.6   Replace netlink code with old-fashioned ioctl, since
	      netlink ARP is buggy in some kernels.

version 0.5   Fixed buffer-expansion code. My understanding of the
	      return-code semantics of recvfrom was faulty.

version 0.4   Re-do network access to use the RTnetlink system and
	      ARP-injection instead of raw packet access. Packet sockets
	      are no longer required, and things like IPsec should now
              work.

version 0.3   Debian packaging changes only.

version 0.2   Added support for broadcast and better parameter sanity 
	      checking.

version 0.1   Initial version.
