Release 1.5.0
	- Embedded root filesystem:
		- Add module-init-tools
		- Updated testsuite
		- Do a modules_prepare to get build setup for new config files
		- Add Oprofile
		- Fix path for iptables finding its shared libraries
		- Add cpu-load script for getting load percent
		- Uclibc support
		- NFS root: Fix path to ethernet driver and chroot
		- Load IPv6 kernel module if it exists
		- Fix bug where fwd rule not supported by ipsec-tools
		- Improve logic on stripping to only strip ELF files
		- Add fold for wrapping lines
		- Bug 799: Disable crypto in tcpdump with --without-crypto

		- Add global option to turn on/off IPv6
		- Add ethtool
		- Add distclean target and make oldconfig silent
		- Fix bug where mii-tool isn't installed
		- Include user-include if it exists and a different dir
			wasn't specified. This makes it easy to add files
			without affecting the rootfs config. It is also
			more like the old minimal_rootfs.
		- Update OpenSSL version from 0.9.8b to 0.9.8d
		- Fix OpenSSL function typecast incompatibility with GCC 4.x
	- Ethernet driver:
		- Add NETPOLL support so we can support netconsole
		- Add define DONT_WRITEBACK to control if FPA frees also tell
			the L2 to throw away changes to the buffer
		- Set carrier status when link goes up or down
		- Provide help information for module parameters
		- Only enable the ethtool interface on RGMII ports
		- Fix long standing bug where RGMII ports are assigned the
			wrong PHY_ID if they're on interface 2 after an
			enabled SPI.
		- Increment RX counters for virtual ports
		- Don't use bootloader MAC addresses for virtual ports
		- Add workaround if bootloader mistakenly leaves GMX enabled
		- Set the MTU before the device comes up. It was defaulting to
			10k
		- Added parameter to skip SPI interface initialization
		- Large rewrite of the RGMII speed code. This code works for
			plug and unplug. It has trouble with unplug/plug with
			half duplex.
		- Fix crash when bridging. Don't put shared/cloned packets in
			the HW pool.
		- Remove reference to non-existent skb->tc_classid
		- Enable backpressure for SPI and RGMII
		- Set NETIF_F_LLTX - We do our own locking, Linux doesn't need
			to. This gives us a major performance boost
		- Add a new option (CVMX_ENABLE_LEN_M8_FIX) for enabling
			hardware fix for errata PKI-100
		- Cleanup simulator support. Don't do RGMII autonegotiation
			and don't read/write unmodeled CSRs.
		- Fix Bug 804. Non aligned buffers were being put in the FPA,
			causing memory corruption.
	- Intercept Module Example
		- Don't crash if ethernet driver isn't loaded. Just print a
			message and stop loading.
	- Add DRAM utilization to /proc/octeon_perf
	- Add sysn32_rt_sigtimedwait back that was removed in 2.6.16. Fixes
		N32 sigtimedwait
	- Change blocksize to 4 in NULL crypto cypher so performance isn't
		quite so bad for kernel IPSEC null encryption.
	- Add CN58XX simulator support.
	- Add CN56XX simulator support.
	- TWSI driver: Fixed problem with multi-byte read transfers (bug#793)
	- Kernel memcpy: Fix bug where prefetches were disabled.
	- Implement set_affinity for IRQs
	- PCI: Updated PCI bus bridge initialization
	- PCI: Fix PCI bug with Intel bridges causing poor performance. Intel bridges
		interpret a cache line size of 128 as an error case. Changed
		PCI cache line size to 64 to avoid this problem.			
	- PCI: Enable error detection and propagation on all PCI bridges.
	- PCI: Configure arbiter to use round robin priority instead of fixed.
		This should prevent a single device from hogging the bus.
	- PCI: Improve EBH3000 interrupt routing
	- PCI: Fix DMA mask determination in dma_map_single to correctly use
		dev->dma_mask. Fix SATA Sil 3124 driver to set DMA mask
		properly. As a side effect, the E1000 is now picked up as a
		64bit device. This fixes the problem with BAR mapping during
		unload.
	- PCI: Eliminate reads from Bar1 index registers on dma_map/unmap.
		This should be much faster.
	- PCI: Enabling smart prefetch and divided fifos for PLX 6540 bridge
	- PCI: Move BAR2 mapping code before BAR0/1 so there isn't ever an
		overlap. Clear pending PCI error interrupts after init.
	- PCI: Add workaround for PCI-302 errata
	- Debian: Refuse to destroy disks larger than 4GB
	- Debian glibc: Update to add missing .set mips0 after code Octeon added
	- Debian: Add uClibc libaries to file system.
	- Implementation of fast TLS access. See the SDK documentation for more
		information.
	- Fix Bug where a RLM interrupt on CN30XX would read Zip block, causing
		strange failures
	- Use sparsemem static instead of extreme. The extreme version uses some
		very early mem alloc that have addressing requirements. These
		can randomly corrupt low memory with any sign. The static
		version is just as good for us.
	- Add POW only ethernet driver for use with networking between cores
		running different Linux kernels. Driver is GPL.
	- CIU interrupt processing assembly was optimized to remove loops.
	- Add config options to lock often used kernel code in the L2
	- Added Octeon specific cache error exception handler.
	- Remove writing zero to L2C perf counters. They are read only.
	- Memcpy: Minor optimizations to save a few cycles
	- Use runtime checks in modules. Undefine OCTEON_MODEL so we'll get
		warnings and errors when it is used.
	- Rewrite RML interrupt handling code to handle all interrupts except
		for GXM and SPI. These should be done in the ethernet driver.
	- Add the natsemi PCI driver to the kernel config
	- Enable IPsec as modules
	- Fix oversight: enable the perfcounter interrupt. This caused Oprofile
		results to be incorrect.
        - Fixed hugetlb support broken in SDK 1.4.0. Under some circumstances
		huge pages may be leaked on program exit.
	- Only enabled the LED block when not simulating and running on a
		CN38XX or CN58XX. CN30XX and CN31XX don't have a LED block.
	- Fix failure of the Silicon Image SATA driver with drives that take
		extremely long times to initialize (Deskstar drives).		
	- Disabled reporting of PIP CRC error messages. The work queue entry
		still shows the errors.

Release 1.4.0
	- Kernel upgrade to 2.6.16.26. A changelog overview for 2.6.16 is
		available at http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16	
	- Upgrade busybox to 1.2.1
	- Replaced the minimal rootfs with a new configurable embedded rootfs.
		The new system support dynamically adding and removing packages
		from the root filesystem using a config interface based on the
		kernel's menuconfig. See the SDK HTML documentation for more
		information.
	- Add support for SATA_SIL24.
	- Add support for the EBH3000.
	- Improved Via IDE support.
	- Fix sign problem causing overflow on loop in dma-octeon.c.
	- Support VESA framebuffer on ATI ES1000.
	- Enable UART interrupts on CN30XX and CN31XX.
	- Add Octeon TWSI driver.
	- Enable kernel preempt support. Disabled by default for better performance.
	- Add branch emulation for Octeon bbit opcodes.
	- Ethernet driver:
		- Enable RED dropping.
		- Fix warnings.
		- Fix bug 582 - freeing wrong pointer to FPA WQE pool.
	- Use console uart boot flag from bootloader to select console uart.
	- Use BAR2 for 64bit PCI devices. This allows these devices to access
		all of memory.
	- Increase number of segments allowed to the fusion drivers.
	- CN30XX/CN31XX USB updates.
	- Add kernel parameter ecc_verbose to turn on single bit errors.
	- Fix Bug 608: Export mips_hpt_frequency
	- Fix Silicon Image SATA driver to fully support 64bit controllers.
	- Compact Flash driver now checks DRQ.
	- Added option for Accelerated IPSEC module (not part of the base SDK).
	- Make NEC USB irq handling more generic.
	- Fix bug where ERET ends up in branch delay slot of TLB handler.
	- Flush pages that might be executable even if they aren't marked
		executed yet. Shared libraries sometimes reset the bits during
		clones.
	- Enable MTD partitioning, cramfs, jffs2.
	- Disable icache prefetch and use random replacement for CN30XX.
	- Add workaround for Core-301 errata. Under rare circumstances IO
		reads could be reordered before IO writes.
	- Add poweroff message on lcd.
	- Change default IO scheduler to CFQ.
	- Add PCI big bar support for CN30XX.

Release 1.3.1
	- High speed USB 2.0 on CN31XX.
	- Cleanup PCI i8259 code.
	- Add Hikari board support.
	- Ethernet changes:
		- Cleanup switch handling to work more automatically for
			CN31XX and CN30XX.
		- Fix Bug #494, JABBER must be 8 byte aligned.
		- Improve packet drop counter.
	- Kernel upgrade to 2.6.14. A changelog overview for 2.6.14 is
		available at http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_14
	- Remove unused OCTEON_PASS1_ADEL workaround.
	- Cleanup references to octeon-app-init.h in smp.c and setup.c.
	- Use Octeon specific version of udelay that works for more than
		999 usecs.
	- Redo board support so a single config supports almost all boards.
	- Update chroot to work with 2.6.14.
	- Fix IRQ routing for NA-038 board.
	- Use flag from bootloader to determine if we are in PCI host mode.
	- Add the processor id to /proc/octeon_info.
	- Rewrite the DMA mapping logic with an Octeon specific version. This
		uses Bar1 to dynamically map memory for PCI DMAs. This allows
		PCI devices to access all of memory up until there are 32
		mappings.
	- Synchronize the core cycle counters on boot. Use the counters for
		faster gettimeofday.
	- Support for SPARSEMEM. This allows Linux to access the 2nd 256MB
		of memory.		
	- Reimplemented 32bit reserved memory using standard mmap calls. 32bit
		applications can now access hardware on boards with less than
		2GB of ram.

Release 1.3.0
	- Optimized bitops.h to use Octeon specific bit operations.
	- Add support for CN31XX.
	- Support 16bit Compact Flash access for CN31XX.
	- Improved page zero and copy functions.
	- Upgraded kernel to 2.6.13.5.
	- Cleanup Busybox dhcp support.
	- Don't allocate the high 256MB of memory. It cost 300MB of page
		tables, so using it gives less usable memory.
	- Add support for MEM= to set the amount of memory in MB. Setting
		it to 0 uses all memory.
	- Add support for different boards:
		EBT3000, EBH3100, Asus-NA038, Gadwin, Thunder
	- Ethernet changes:
		- Process 60 packet per interrupt instead of 30. At the current
			max, 254k, the max of 300k was getting in the way.
		- Add module interface for interception.
		- Add tag switch to NULL when bail early and don't get NULL
			from get work.
		- Add support for more generic SPI4, not just the SPI4000.
		- Add CRC when using SPI without SPI4000.
		- Enable relaxed RGMII preamble checking for pass2.
		- Support HW free of sent packets when possible.
		- Add proc interface to get detailed statistics.
		- Fix bug where pow send list didn't set the hard start xmit
			correctly.
		- Print the error code on receive error.
		- Switch to netif_receive_skb for better performance.
		- Bug fix in dealing with TCP/UDP payload checksum errors.
			Previous drivers would silently accept these and tell
			the kernel to not check them. The fix still passes them
			to the kernel, but without disabling the L4 checksum
			validation.
	- Use per cpu stats instead of global stats to reduce cache thrashing
		for floating point emulator.
	- Disable LL/SC on non SMP systems. It is faster to disable interrupts
		for atomic access than a LL/SC.
	- PCI Host mode support.
	- New utility oct-linux-profile.
	- Add syncw before wait instruction.
	- Preliminary support for CN31XX USB.
	- Add support for determining flash location and size from bootbus
		region configuration. This allows a single kernel image to
		support various flash sizes.
	- Add intercept example.
	- Replace memaccess with oct-linux-csr.
	- Fix build failure when HugeTLB is off.

Release 1.2.0
	- Added /dev/mtdblock0 for on board flash access
	- Save/Restore COP2, CVMSEG, and MULT on context switch. See the SDK
		documentation for the Linux kernel for more information.
	- Improve efficiency of cache flushing.
		- Only flush cores that a vma has used
		- Directly send IPI signal instead of using smp_call_function
	- Fix bug where interrupts aren't enabled early enough
	- Ethernet driver
		- Fix problems with unloading the ethernet driver.		
		- Fix crash if packet comes in for non existent Linux device
		- Reduce the number of buffers from 4096 to 1024 to improve
			forwarding performance.
		- Fix problems with multicore input.
		- Fix bug in tx free list. Use 64bit scratch for IOBDMA instead
			of 32bit.
		- Use hardware counters for byte and packet counter to
			eliminate the need for locking.
		- Add define USE_MULTICORE_RECEIVE to use the all cores for
			receive. Turned on by default.
		- Add preliminary MII and ethtool support.
		- Don't throw away packets that exceed the max L2 frame
		- Move the ethernet driver out of the kernel tree into its own
			directory.
		- Change MAC address handing. Multicast was backwards
		- Don't throw away packets that exceed the max L2 frame
		- Use tasklets instead of processing in interrupt context.
			Improves performance by reducing dcache thrashing. Each
			packet is processed immediately instead of being queued
			and then processed.
		- Rate limit debug messages
		- Limit each core to processing 30 packets without a break.
			This way the RX can't starve the TX task.
		- Jumbo packet support
	- Removed creation of separate bootmem list for 32 bit applications
		- If a 32 bit memory region is configured, the kernel will not
			allocate memory for itself from that region. (This is
			not a change of behaviour, it is now just implemented
			differently.)
	- Improve time accuracy on Pass2 and higher chips.
	- Improve lock/unlock primitives
	- Fix bug where cpu 0 isn't signaled when other cores come up.
	- Fix bug where the BKL was configured for preemption.
	- Pass 2 support
		- Use cache mode 7 for Octeon Pass2 special marking
		- Only disable prefetching for Octeon Pass1
	- Reduce the amount of messages displayed as cores come up. Only one
		line per core now.
	- Add support for GDB console.
	- Add  read_current_timer for better calibration delay calculation.
	- Fix spinlock deadlock on sysrq key.
	- Fix bug where writev would fail for zero byte entries.
	- Don't waste time calibrating the delay on secondary cores
	- Skip calibration delay on the simulator
	- Use optimized interrupt enable/disable on Octeon
	- Make generic_swap routine use 64bit loads/stores as much as possible
	- Fix to use OCTEON_IPD_CLK_COUNT on Pass2 and nothing on Pass1
 	- Fix problems when building with SMP disabled
	- Make the Adel workaround a kernel config option. On for EBT3000, off
		for sim.
	- Cleanup handling of bootmem. Kernel now only depends on
		target/include/open-license
	- Fix emulation of rdhwr to not suppress cop0 errors.
	- HugeTLB support

Release 1.1.0
	- Upgrade to Linux 2.6.13
	- Initial release Debian GNU/Linux for Octeon.
		- Oprofile support.
		- Native toolchains for O32, N32, and N64.
		- Native GDB.

		- Handle low level receive errors by dropping the packet.
		- Fix race condition on statistics update.
		- Added parameter "always_use_pow" to override ethernet output.
			See the Linux documentation for a description.
		- Use the normal CVMX config for FPA pool numbering and PKO
			queue configuration. cvmx-config can be used to create
			multiple output queues per port.
	- Move Compact flash accesses into a kernel thread.
	- Minimal root filesystem:
		- Add fstab for better mount support.
		- Mount /sys by default.
		- Switch away from devfs. It is deprecated. Now the filesystem
			is expected to supply everything in /dev. Device names
			now match what most distributions expect.
	- Added support for 50Mhz reference clock.
	- Disable interrupts to all cores when disabling or shutting down
		and interrupt line. The freeing of the interrupt handler
		may be done on a different core than the request_irq.
	- Various system calls fixed for N32 and N64.
	- Fix initialization of L2 counters for /proc/octeon_perf.
	- Report POW memory ECC errors.
	- New interface "/proc/octeon_info" to pass bootloader information
		into userspace.
	- Disable serial port 2 under Linux. It interferes with using simple
		executive applications on other cores. The simple executive
		debugger was being triggered.
		
Release 1.0.0
	- Added kernel support for Oprofile
	- Replace MTD compact flash driver with a full block device supporting
		partitions. Device names have changed from /dev/mtdblock/1 to
		/dev/cfa/part1. Compact flashes can now contain multiple

	- Added userspace access to the Octeon performance counters through
		/proc/octeon_perf. Documentation can be found in the Linux
		userspace documentation of the SDK.
	- Improved hardware BIST checking
	- Modified memory allocation order. Using the 256MB located at
		0x410000000 caused problems with userspace.
	- System call sys_lookup_dcookie() fixed for O32 applications.
	- Increased the clock frequency on hardware to 1khz. Simulator still
		uses 100hz.
