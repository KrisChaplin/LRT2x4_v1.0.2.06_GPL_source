1. What is in this release
---------------------------
This release contains the source code for the Octeon OpenSSL Crypto Engine
v0.2 on Octeon Linux.

2. Supported Operating Modes
-----------------------------
     This release supports the following Operating modes
            - Linux N32
            - Linux N64

     This release has been tested with Octeon PASS2 Chipset.

3. Dependencies
---------------
This release requires the following Octeon RPMS:
   a) Octeon SDK v1.4.0 (Build 153)
   b) Octeon Linux v1.4.0 (Build 153)
   c) Octeon Core Crypto RPM v0.7.0


4. Installed Directory structure
--------------------------------

Octeon SDK is usually installed under /usr/local/Cavium_Networks folder
as CN3XXX-SDK.
This rpm is also installed under the same folder as

  |---CN3XXX-SDK
      |
      |--- applications/linux_engine
      |         (source files for building the Engine)

5. Pre-requisites to Compiling the Engine 
------------------------------------------

a) Setup the Octeon Development environment.
     #cd /usr/local/Cavium_Networks/CN3XXX-SDK
     #source env-setup-PASS2.bash
     (If you are running on any other shell other than bash,
      corresponding script needs to be run.)
        This will setup the OCTEON_ROOT environment variable.

b) Compile and boot Linux on Octeon
     # cd /usr/local/Cavium_Networks/CN3XXX-SDK/linux/embedded_rootfs
	  # make menuconfig
	      Select Toolchain ABI to be either 64 or N32.
			And, also make sure octcrypto and engine are selected.
			Save this configuration and exit.
	  # cd /usr/local/Cavium_Networks/CN3XXX-SDK/linux
	  # make kernel
     (Please refer to SDK Documentation on HOWTO boot Linux
      on Octeon)

c) Load the Crypto ModExp Module on Octeon Linux
     # insmod /lib/modules/cavmodexp.ko

d) Create Crypto Device for interface to the User Application
   on Octeon Linux.
      # mknod /dev/octcrypto c 125 0

5. Compiling the Engine Library for Octeon
-------------------------------------------
	Compiling the Linux will compile the Engine on Octeon,
	The libocteon.so is available in the Filesystem as
	    /usr/lib64   if ABI 64 is selected
		  or
		 /usr/lib32   if ABI N32 is selected 

6. Testing  Engine using openssl
---------------------------------
#  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32
          or
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64

# openssl s_server -engine octeon
     This sample application uses "octeon" crypto acceleration.

8. Supported Features
---------------------

   a. Ciphers
         RC4 (128 bit)
         3DES
         AES 128
         AES 256
         DES (64 bit)
   b. Digests
         MD5
         SHA1
   c. Key Exchange
		   RSA
			DH
			DSA
